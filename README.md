# CH Term Implementation Guide
This FHIR® implementation guide contains terminology that is used in Switzerland for the core profiles, various exchange formats and also in the context of the Swiss electronic patient record (EPR). See also [fhir.ch](https://fhir.ch/).

The EPR metadata is specified in the Annexes of the Swiss EPR [FDHA Ordinance](https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/de/home/gesetze-und-bewilligungen/gesetzgebung/gesetzgebung-mensch-gesundheit/gesetzgebung-elektronisches-patientendossier.html) on the electronic patient record in Switzerland.    
The EPR artifacts are based on the [CH-EPR](http://ehealthsuisse.art-decor.org/index.php?prefix=ch-epr-) [ART-DECOR](https://www.art-decor.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page) project which has been [published by eHealth Suisse](http://ehealthsuisse.art-decor.org/).

## Art-Decor

### Instances
* Work instance: https://art-decor.org/art-decor/decor-valuesets--ch-epr-
   * The currently valid version of a value set is not always displayed in the edit screen. To find the currently valid version, you have to select it manually from the drop-down menu of the respective value set. When selecting, you have to pay attention to the version tag, not the date. 
* Publication instance: https://ehealthsuisse.art-decor.org/index.php?prefix=ch-epr-
   * This instance is a bit clearer and more user-friendly than the work instance. 
   * Here, all versions of a value set are displayed in a clear overview.

### Changelog
* The link to the changelog must be updated with each new release.
* You can also see all changelogs on the working instance under “Project” and then “Version information”.

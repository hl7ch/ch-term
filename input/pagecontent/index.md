### Introduction
This FHIR速 implementation guide contains terminology that is used in Switzerland for the core profiles, various exchange formats and also in the context of the Swiss electronic patient record (EPR). See also [fhir.ch](https://fhir.ch/).

The EPR metadata is specified in the Annexes of the Swiss EPR [FDHA Ordinance](https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/de/home/gesetze-und-bewilligungen/gesetzgebung/gesetzgebung-mensch-gesundheit/gesetzgebung-elektronisches-patientendossier.html) on the electronic patient record in Switzerland.    
The EPR artifacts are based on the [CH-EPR](http://ehealthsuisse.art-decor.org/index.php?prefix=ch-epr-) [ART-DECOR](https://www.art-decor.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page) project which has been [published by eHealth Suisse](http://ehealthsuisse.art-decor.org/).

### Scope
This implementation guide contains the Swiss terminology defined via FHIR processable artifacts:
* [Code Systems](codesystems.html)
* [Value Sets](valuesets.html)
* [Concept Maps](conceptmaps.html)
* [Naming Systems](namingsystems.html)

### Collaboration & Governance
This implementation guide is the result of collaborative work undertaken with participants from [HL7 Switzerland](https://www.hl7.ch) and [eHealth Suisse](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/startseite.html).

- A yearly major release is foreseen to support the Swiss balloted IGs, with an interim version published to support the HL7 Switzerland ballot phase.
- Additions or changes can only be made through reviewed pull requests (PRs). In addition, PRs must be reviewed and accepted by the responsible parties of the respective HL7 Switzerland working groups, if the terminology resources are used within their implementation guides.
- Patch releases can be made upon request to the FHIR working group. Dependent IGs on CH Term should allow patched versions.
- For terminology resources where CH Term is not the authority or master, the conformance resource needs to indicate the authority in `meta.source` (see [example](https://fhir.ch/ig/ch-term/ValueSet-DocumentEntry.authorRole.json.html) for ART-DECOR).
- Only stable versions of ValueSets are published when there are multiple versions of ValueSets (e.g. DocumentEntry.typeCode), due to the fact that the tooling currently supports only one version ([background](https://github.com/hl7ch/ch-term/issues/5)).

### Introduction
This FHIR速 implementation guide contains terminology that is used in Switzerland for the core profiles, various exchange formats and also in the context of the Swiss electronic patient record (EPR). See also [fhir.ch](https://fhir.ch/).

The EPR metadata is specified in the Annexes of the Swiss EPR [FDHA Ordinance](https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/de/home/gesetze-und-bewilligungen/gesetzgebung/gesetzgebung-mensch-gesundheit/gesetzgebung-elektronisches-patientendossier.html) on the electronic patient record in Switzerland.    
The EPR artifacts are based on the [CH-EPR](http://ehealthsuisse.art-decor.org/index.php?prefix=ch-epr-) [ART-DECOR](https://www.art-decor.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page) project which has been [published by eHealth Suisse](http://ehealthsuisse.art-decor.org/).

### Scope
This implementation guide contains the Swiss terminology defined via FHIR processable artifacts:
* [Code Systems](codesystems.html)
* [Value Sets](valuesets.html)
* [Concept Maps](conceptmaps.html)
* [Naming Systems](namingsystems.html)

### Collaboration & Governance

This implementation guide is the product of collaborative work undertaken with participants from [HL7 Switzerland](https://www.hl7.ch) and [eHealth Suisse](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/startseite.html)

- a yearly major release is foreseen to support the swiss balloted ig's with a interim version published for supporting the Hl7 switzerland ballot phase
- addition / changes can only be done through reviewed pull requests
- in addition pull requests (PR) needs to be accepted / reviewed by the responsible of the different swiss HL7.ch work groups, if the terminology resources are used within their implementation guides
- patch releases can be done on request to the FHIR work group, dependent IG's on CH Term should allow patched versions
- for terminology resources where CH Term is not the authority/master, the conformance resource needs to indicate the authority in meta.source ([example for art-decor](https://fhir.ch/ig/ch-term/ValueSet-DocumentEntry.authorRole.json.html))
- only stable versions of ValueSets will be published if there a multiple versions of ValueSets (e.g. DocumentEntry.typeCode) due that the tooling supports currently one version [background](https://github.com/hl7ch/ch-term/issues/5).

This ConceptMap is auto generated by a routine script by using the mapping of disease codes [CH VACD Target disease and illnesses undergone for immunization](ValueSet-ch-vacd-targetdiseasesandillnessesundergoneforimmunization-vs.html) corresponding to the respective vaccine codes out of the different CodeSystems.
There is a small portion of incorrectness in this mapping. Please make always a check using this mapping.

Out of this mapping a user should be able to get an corresponding vaccine code out of the ValueSet [CH VACD Snomed CT for VaccineCode](ValueSet-ch-vacd-vaccines-snomedct-vs.html) in relation to the code from the ValueSet [CH VACD Swissmedic code for VaccineCode](ValueSet-ch-vacd-vaccines-vs.html).

* [#equal](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-concept-map-equivalence.html#concept-map-equivalence-equal) means that the coverage of the both vaccines against target diseases is fully equal. i.e. Vaccine for Di Te Per
* [#narrower](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-concept-map-equivalence.html#concept-map-equivalence-narrower) means that the coverage of the target vaccine will have a smaller range of protection against target diseases.
* [#wider](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-concept-map-equivalence.html#concept-map-equivalence-wider) means that the coverage of the target vaccine will have a larger range of protection against target diseases.
